Thanks for checking it out.\n\nAll documentation is in the \"docs\" directory and online at\nhttp://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/. If you're just getting started, here's\nhow we recommend you read the docs:\n\n* First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.\n\n* Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt,\n  docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).\n\n* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read\n  docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.\n\n* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics)\n  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific\n  problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.\n\n* See docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.\n\nDocs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they\nshould be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket\nhere:\n\nhttp://code.djangoproject.com/newticket\n\nTo get more help:\n\n* Join the #django channel on irc.freenode.net. Lots of helpful people hang out\n  there. Read the archives at http://django-irc-logs.com/.\n\n* Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at\n  http://groups.google.com/group/django-users.\n\nTo contribute to Django:\n\n* Check out http://www.djangoproject.com/community/ for information about\n  getting involved.\n\nTo run Django's test suite:\n\n* Follow the instructions in the \"Unit tests\" section of\n  docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt, published online at\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests\n",
